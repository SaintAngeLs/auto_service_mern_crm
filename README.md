## Introduction

Provide a brief introduction to your project. Explain what it does and its purpose.

## Features

List the key features of your project:

### **App.ts (Main Express App Configuration)**

This file sets up the Express application and incorporates the required middleware for request processing, database connection, CORS, and routing.

#### **Database Connection**

It connects to MongoDB using mongoose and provides error handling for connection errors.

#### **Middlewares**

- `bodyParser`: Parses incoming request bodies.
- Custom middleware for CORS errors.
- Routing for different services like authentication, cars, services, orders, and mechanics.
- Error handling for 404 and general errors.

### **check-auth.ts (Authentication and Authorization Middlewares)**

This file contains middleware for verifying JWT tokens and checking if a user has an ADMIN role.

#### **verifyToken**

Extracts the token from the headers and verifies it. If valid, the user ID is attached to the request object.

#### **isAdmin**

Checks if the authenticated user has the ADMIN role.

### **Controlers**

## Run Locally

- To clone the Project

```bash
  git clone  ... the repo ...
```
- Go to Client directory to run the frontend

```bash
  cd Client/automitive_service_app
```
- To Run the frontend
```bash
  nvm use 18 && npm install && npm start
```

## Auth:
admin: admin@email.com  admin3141592   |  test@email.com    test3141592   |    

### For Back-End

#### Configure your Database with NodeJs

- Go to the Back-End project directory

```bash
  cd Server
```
- There are 4 Microservices
- Inside each Microservice a dbConfig.js file is there in config folder. Inside that you have to provide your database credentials.
- Install dependencies for each Microservice (Admin, Customer, Mechaninc, Order).

```bash
  cd Admin
```

```bash
nvm use 18 && npm install
```
- Start the server of all Microservices.

```bash
  node Server.js # or the next like is far more comfortable for the specific reason 
  npm start
```

- For the ADMIN access you need to insert a record mannually in the members database as a role ADMIN. 

## USer login

ADMIN user_name: admin@email.com
ADMIN password: admin3141592

MECHANIC user_name: user@email.com
MECHANIC password: user3141592

CUSTOMER user_name: test@email.com
CUSTOMER password: test3141592

### Docker section: it will be optimized later

To run the whole application with the Docker, run the next comand from the root directory of the project:
```bash
docker-compose up 
```
