## JWT implementation


> JWT Implementation

In our application, we have implemented our own version of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication purposes. This solution is an alternative to the standard libraries available for JWT, crafted specifically for our needs.

> How it Works:

1. **Header**: The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token (JWT) and the hashing algorithm being used (e.g., HS256). We encode this in base64 format.
2. **Payload**: The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about the user and additional metadata. We have also added an expiration claim (`exp`) which specifies when the token expires. We encode this in base64 format.
3. **Signature**: For the signature, we take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, and then use the HMAC SHA256 algorithm to hash them together. This ensures that the message hasn't been changed along the way.

> Code Implementation:

> Creating a JWT:

```typescript

import * as tsCryptoLib from './Crypto-lib/Crypto-ts/src/HmacSHA256';
import { Base64, Hex, Utf8, Word32Array, Word64Array } from './Crypto-lib/Crypto-ts/src';


const secret = '31415926535898_superSuperSecretKey';  // Ensure to keep this secret very secure.

export const createJWT = (payload: object, expiresIn: number): string => {
  // ... [more specific side of implementation is in the utils/jwtutil.ts]
};
```

> Verifying a JWT:

Verifying the token involves decoding it and ensuring the signature matches. Additionally, we check if the token has expired.

```typescript
export const verifyJWT = (token: string): any => {
  // ... [more specific side of implementation is in the utils/jwtutil.ts]
};
```

> Security Concerns:

- The secret used in hashing the JWT should be kept private. Exposure can lead to JWTs being forged.
  
- The JWT does not encrypt the payload or the header. If there's any sensitive information, consider another method of transmitting it or use encryption methods in combination with JWT.

- Ensure the expiration time (`exp` claim) is set appropriately to balance between user convenience and security.

> Conclusion:

Our JWT implementation provides a robust method for ensuring secure authentication in our application. Always validate JWTs server-side and never trust information from a client without verification.

### For Back-End

#### Configure your Database with NodeJs

- Go to the Back-End project directory

```bash
  cd Server
```
- There are 4 Microservices
- Inside each Microservice a dbConfig.js file is there in config folder. Inside that you have to provide your database credentials.
- Install dependencies for each Microservice (Admin, Customer, Manager, Order).

```bash
  cd Admin
```

```bash
nvm use 18 && npm install
```
- Start the server of all Microservices.

```bash
  node Server.js # or the next like is far more comfortable for the specific reason 
  npm start
```

- For the ADMIN access you need to insert a record mannually in the members database as a role ADMIN. 

## User login

ADMIN user_name: admin@email.com
ADMIN password: admin3141592

MANAGER user_name: user@email.com
MANAGER password: user3141592

CUSTOMER user_name: test@email.com
CUSTOMER password: test3141592

### Docker section: it will be optimized later

To run the whole application with the Docker, run the next comand from the root directory of the project:
```bash
docker-compose up 
```
